% Template MATLAB code for reading data from a private channel, analyzing
% the data and storing the analyzed data in another channel.

% Prior to running this MATLAB code template, assign the channel ID to read
% data from to the 'readChannelID' variable. Since this is a private
% channel, also assign the read API Key to the 'readAPIKey' variable. You
% can find the read API Key in the right side pane of this page.

% To store the analyzed data, you will need to write it to a channel other
% than the one you are reading data from. Assign this channel ID to the
% 'writeChannelID' variable. Also assign the write API Key to the
% 'writeAPIKey' variable below. You can find the write API Key in the right
% side pane of this page.

% TODO - Replace the [] with channel ID to read data from:
readChannelID =714903;
% TODO - Enter the Read API Key between the '' below:
readAPIKey = 'VAQXA4UOYIEIYCPJ';

% TODO - Replace the [] with channel ID to write data to:
writeChannelID =714951;
% TODO - Enter the Write API Key between the '' below:
writeAPIKey = '2MIJN1QYE6NLKWI7';
